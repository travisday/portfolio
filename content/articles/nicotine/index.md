title: 'Nicotine, a vastly misunderstood chemical'
description: 'Nicotine is the well known drug found in cigarettes, vapes, and other tobacco products. Smoking is known to cause lung cancer and many other diseases. The connection nicotine has to these products has caused the media to vilify the drug. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug and can be toxic to the body at certain dosages, however research has shown that nicotine can enhance cognition and serve as a potential therapy for Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and ADHD.'

Introduction
“Nicotine = Brain poison”. This is the campaign slogan from the California Department of Public Health Tobacco Control Program [1]. Their commercial can be seen here. The program’s goal is to fight the tobacco industry’s use of flavored vaping products to get kids addicted to nicotine. Nicotine has become synonymous with smoking and vaping, and in this specific context the claim that nicotine is brain poison is true. Nicotine can alter adolescent brain development, especially at the high amounts vaping products can deliver [1]. Due to this and the fact that smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases, nicotine has been turned into a villainous chemical that should be avoided at all costs. However, nicotine is a complex chemical that does many things in the brain and studies have shown that nicotine, independent of smoking and vaping, can enhance cognitive performance and protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

A brief history of tobacco
Nicotine is a naturally occurring substance in the nightshade family of plants. The most well known plant that contains nicotine is tobacco. Tobacco originated in America and was spread and popularized by Native Americans. The start of tobacco use in Europe began after Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492 when the Native Americans used dried tobacco leaves to barter with the Europeans. By the 16th century tobacco use could be found in almost every country in Europe [2]. In 1826 nicotine was discovered as the psychoactive chemical in tobacco. More information on how nicotine was discovered can be found here. In 1912 the connection between smoking and lung cancer was discovered. In 1924 over 70 billion cigarettes were sold. This growth was partly attributed to the supply of cigarettes to soldiers in World War I. When these soldiers returned they were all addicted. In 1967 the Surgeon General definitively linked smoking to lung cancer. Following this, tobacco manufacturers faced many lawsuits and were forced to print warning labels that smoking is a health hazard and were limited in how they could advertise. In 1992 the first nicotine patch was introduced and other cessation products were introduced later. During the late 1990’s and early 2000’s bans on public smoking went into effect in most states in America as well as other countries in the world [2].

Figure 1: Tobacco Timeline [2]
Nicotine Addiction
Nicotine is a highly addictive chemical. In 1994 the FDA announced its intention to consider regulating cigarettes [4]. The primary effort was to find the amount of nicotine needed to develop an addiction. Cigarettes deliver anywhere from .3mg to 3.2mg of nicotine [4]. Sofuoglu and LeSage (2012) reviewed the current concepts and research regarding the addictive threshold for nicotine and they concluded that an addiction threshold could be determined in controlled lab settings but that this does not reflect what happens in the real world. This is due largely to the lack of consensus on how to best measure nicotine addiction in the scientific community [5]. Even though the FDA’s research conducted by Benowitz and Henningfield (1994) showed that to become addicted to nicotine a daily intake of 4mg to 6mg is required [4], Sofuoglu and LeSage argue that the threshold could actually be much lower [5]. 

Determining an addictive threshold for any drug is a difficult problem. Not everyone absorbs drugs the same way. Furthermore, the different routes of administration of the same drug can affect the absorption (see Figure 2) and taking into account height, weight, and gender differences it gets very complicated [5]. This is certainly a factor in the vilification of nicotine, as we know it is highly addictive but the specific threshold of addiction is not concrete. A deeper look into nicotine addiction can be found here.
Nicotine Administration
There are many ways you can take nicotine. Some common forms other than smoking include chewing gum, lozenges, skin patches, nasal sprays, and injections. Injections are common in research settings for administering highly controlled doses.

Figure 2: Common Forms of Nicotine Administration

What nicotine does in your body
Nicotine has two main effects, a stimulant effect and a reward effect [3]. When nicotine enters your body, it binds to receptor sites in your brain and triggers the release of neurotransmitters [3]. Neurotransmitters are chemicals in your nervous system that trigger actions in your body and make you feel certain ways. Nicotine has been found to release norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, beta-endorphin, GABA, and glutamate [3]. These neurotransmitters are all multifaceted but can be broken down into three main categories: mood effects, physical effects, and cognitive effects.
Mood effects
Nicotine releases dopamine and serotonin which are both regulators of mood [12].
Dopamine is the main neurotransmitter that makes us feel pleasure and reward. Nicotine addiction comes from the release of dopamine. The administration of nicotine is connected to feeling good so you repeat the dosing. As you take more, your body develops a tolerance and it takes a higher dose for you to get the same feeling from dopamine. As this cycle continues your body gets more and more dependent on nicotine [11].

Physical effects
The physical effects felt from nicotine are an increased heart rate and blood pressure and suppressed arousal and appetite [8]. This comes from the nervous systems parasympathetic response. The body's central nervous system has two main modes: sympathetic and parasympathetic. The parasympathetic nervous system is our body's ‘fight or flight’ response and the sympathetic is our ‘rest and digest’. The majority of the time our body’s are spent in the sympathetic mode; only when we are struck with large amounts of fear, anxiety, or stress do we enter the parasympathetic mode.

The neurotransmitters responsible for putting the body in this mode are norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and beta-endorphins. Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter that increases your heart rate and blood pressure [3]. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that activates your muscles to move and regulates arousal, cognitive functions, and sleep [9]. A more subtle effect is pain relief by the beta-endorphins. Endorphins are natural pain relievers made by your body. They are released in response to pain or stress, for example when you exercise. However, they can also released when you have sex, eat, or make art (music, paintings, etc.) [10].

Cognitive effects
Glutamate and GABA are responsible for creating the cognitive effects of nicotine. Glutamate creates connections between neurons in the brain which enhances learning and memory [6]. GABA blocks certain signals in your brain decreasing activity in specific areas, this can result in feeling less anxiety, stress, and fear which can help you think clearer and focus [7]. 

Figure 3: Structures of Neurotransmitters
Given all these effects it is not a surprise that nicotine can have a positive effect on cognitive performance. A more in depth look at the pharmacology of nicotine can be found here. 

Drugs that enhance cognitive performance are known as nootropics. Caffeine is the most widely used nootropic, but there are many lesser known nootropics. An overview of other nootropics can be found here. There has been a lot of research about nicotine as a nootropic and neuroprotective agent, however, the full extent of how nicotine works in the brain is still a mystery. 

The research
Nicotine by itself is commercially used to aid in quitting smoking or vaping, however, clinically it has been researched for its cognitive effects and neuroprotective qualities. There are many studies about nicotine in both humans and rodents. There are too many studies to go over all of them in this article, so the following studies are the highlights for nicotine's potential use for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection.

Human studies
To test cognitive effects of nicotine in humans, researchers select two groups of individuals; one that is given nicotine and the other that is given a placebo (known as the control group). Both groups undergo certain performance tests before and after the drug is administered (either nicotine or the placebo). The results will show if nicotine had any effect on performance.

Researchers Foulds et al. (1996) tested the effects of nicotine on smokers who were abstaining and people who never smoked. Participants were given an injection of nicotine or saline (placebo). Performance on a variety of cognitive tests was measured before and after the injection. Some of the tasks tested were news recall, memory, reaction time, logical reasoning, rapid visual information processing (RVIP), long-term word recognition, and number recall. In abstinent smokers nicotine produced faster correct responses on the logical reasoning test and RVIP, faster reaction times, and more correct responses on word recognition. In non-smokers, nicotine produced faster reaction times on the RVIP and digit-recall tasks. Foulds et al. concluded that nicotine has a primary effect of enhancing cognitive performance [13].

There is a phenomenon that researchers have noticed where people diagnosed with ADHD will self medicate by smoking [14], [15]. Subsequently, there has been an interest in how nicotine affects the cognitive deficits associated with ADHD. There are two main cognitive deficits caused by ADHD: the lack of ability to respond to a task due to environmental distractions and impulsive behavior. Researchers Potter and Newhouse tested non-smoking young adults with ADHD on tasks that specifically measured the cognitive deficits; the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and the choice delay task (CDT). Tests were done with and without administering nicotine. The results concluded that cognitive performance was improved following nicotine administration and that this may be a useful therapy for people with ADHD [16].

Nicotine has also been studied for its potential protective effects in the brain. The two most common neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s are incredibly complex and do not have a cure. More information of Parkinson’s can be found in this video and more information on Alzheimer's can be found in this video. Data has shown that smokers have less occurrences of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. It was hypothesized that this was because of the effects nicotine has on the brain. Researchers Piao et al. reviewed the effects of nicotine on Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. They concluded that nicotine acts as a neuroprotective agent and decreases the development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s [17].

Rodent studies
Even though nicotine research has been approved for humans it is still beneficial for researchers to test the effects of drugs on rodents. Rodent studies are quicker and less expensive to conduct than human studies and the researchers can use the results to make hypotheses for humans.

Researchers Wolter et al. tested the hypothesis that drugs of abuse can enhance memory consolidation. The results indicated that rats injected with nicotine after a training session performed better on object recognition tasks than rats not injected. This study also found that rats injected with cocaine performed better object recognition tasks than rats who were not injected. Wolter et al. concluded that nicotine (and cocaine) have the ability to enhance memory consolidation [18].

Researchers Shang et al. tested if nicotine was able to improve the cognition deficits associated with chronic stress. Mice were divided into three groups: control, stress induced mice, and stress induced mice with nicotine treatment. The mice given nicotine performed better on cognition tasks and had lower levels of anxiety [19].

Researchers Allison and Shoaib studied the effects of nicotine and attentional flexibility. Attentional flexibility is the ability to perform well when changing from one task to another. This study focused on testing attentional shifting tasks to fill the gap in the research. Most prior studies focused purely on cognitive performance. The attentional set shifting task is a standard test developed to measure the attention and cognitive flexibility in rats [20]. This study concluded that nicotine improves attentional flexibility in rats [21].

Takeaway
Nicotine is a vastly misunderstood chemical. The negative effects of nicotine are widely known due to its part in smoking and vaping. Valid clinical uses of nicotine are not nearly as widely researched. The research shows that nicotine can boost cognitive performance and act as a neuroprotective agent in the brain. Nicotine can also be toxic and the line between beneficial and toxic depends on many factors some of which are dose, frequency, and type of administration. Clinical research of nicotine has been going on for decades, but there is still a lot of research that needs to be done to fully understand what nicotine does in the body. 
The current research on nicotine therapy for Parkinson's and Alzheimer’s disease is very exciting as these diseases currently have no treatments. Even if it does not become a viable treatment the knowledge gained about these diseases gives us more of an understanding about how the brain works. The use of nicotine as an ADHD therapy is also very exciting. This could be a better treatment option than the current treatments such as Adderall or Vyvanse. This research could also give us more insights to how our brain works and the disorders and diseases that plague them.

Society is quick to label a drug as good or bad, but I don’t believe there is such a thing as good or bad drugs. Drugs are simply chemicals that are either naturally occurring or synthesized. It is what human’s do with the drugs that make them good or bad. Nicotine is a perfect example. When smoked or vaped at high concentrations nicotine can create a host of problems, but in the clinical setting it can have a host of benefits. Drugs are tools and we are discovering new uses for them everyday.
