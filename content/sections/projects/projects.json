      "description": "During my internship at Childdren's Hospital Los Angeles I worked with an ICU doctor to develop a machine learning model that predicted cardiac death in patients who were taken off of life sustaining support. Together we co-authored a clinical machine learning paper that was published in a high impact medical journal (link below). After the paper was published my model was deployed in the ICU as a bedside tool for doctors.",

Users can send notifcations to other userss of the app but the only content of the message they can send is SUP!. The twist is that you only have a certain ammount of sups to send per day, and you get points by sending sups.",
