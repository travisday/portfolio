After I graduated USC with my degree in computer science I joined Deloitte Consulting full time. Prior to graduating I accumulated internships and experiences in Data Science,
Machine Learning, and Software Development. While I find almost every aspect of the tech world fascinating my main passion is Data Science.

To offset my time spent on a computer I like to surf, camp, and be outside.
